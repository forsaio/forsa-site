##STRATEGY

*We help NGOs, Business, and Governments understand how to use technology to engage with their constituents and deliver better services.*

Often organizations know that technology can be used to improve their work, but they don’t know the solutions available or how to find them. Forsa leverages a deep knowledge of cutting-edge technologies along with extensive experience designing solutions for tough problems in diverse contexts to help organizations develop strategies for integrating available technologies into their service delivery.

Forsa consultants embed within organizations and communities in order to understand the your unique challenges. We’ll use field research and data analytics to gain a holistic understanding of contexts and challenges to help your organization develop bespoke solutions. This includes developing approaches to tackle old problems with new technologies, helping teams learn how to re-deploy existing resources, and assisting organizations engage with the best developers to supply the right technology for the unique circumstances.

##DESIGN

*We use big data analytics, community centered design thinking, and our deep knowledge of cutting edge technologies to design bespoke solutions.*

We combine community centered design thinking and agile development to design services and technologies which are context responsive and user oriented. Forsa works with organizations to understand user needs and contextual requirements, then we’ll produce rapid prototyping, gather extensive feedback, and refine each design through a process of continuous iteration and testing. 

Forsa consultants have extensive experience designing and managing the use of technology and service delivery, including big data analytics and cutting edge mobile-phone applications, in a variety in complex international environments. We draw on our experience as designers and implementers ****

##IMPLEMENTATION

*We embed in organizations and communities to help them implement solutions efficiently and effectively.*

When organizations are launching new services or software tools, it helps to have experts on hand to make sure the process is as smooth as possible. When you’re working with a number of partners to build new tools, it can be challenging to bring them all together. Forsa consultants work alongside our clients to manage the technology implementation processes. We embed within organizations to ensure that development process is responsive to a client’s needs, incorporates frequent feedback, and is delivered on time and on budget. We’re on the ground to handle interface with all necessary partners and stakeholders, gather inputs that require an in-person presence, and quickly resolve any complications that might arise.

##LEARNING

*We use quantitative research and qualitative analysis to understand experiences, evaluating what works, what doesn’t, and why. We design and deliver experiential training programs for our clients, building communities of capable practitioners with each engagement.*

We’re committed to making sure that every engagement is an opportunity for growth and improvement. Our learning process is agile, and begins with the start of each engagement when Forsa consultants will evaluate available data through quantitative analysis, rapid institutional ethnographies, and stakeholder interviews to understand the unique aspects of each engagement. We then design a research and evaluation framework to rapidly evaluate each product and service as it’s being designed. As feedback and testing is collected, we’ll tweak designs and re-evaluate each iteration to ensure that the final design is the best.

Forsa consultants are also experienced teachers, and we incorporate training into all of our engagements. We work with our clients to help them use data and mixed-methods to evaluate the efficacy of their work long after our engagement has finished. When appropriate, Forsa will also design and lead trainings for our clients or their partners. Our trainings centered around experiential learning, and Forsa will make sure that everyone being trained has mastered the use of a product before we leave.
