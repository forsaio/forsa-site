##STRATEGY

*We help NGOs, Business, and Governments understand how to use technology to engage with their constituents and deliver better services.*

Often organizations know that technology can be used to improve their work, but they don’t know the solutions available or how to find them. Forsa leverages a deep knowledge of cutting-edge technologies along with extensive experience designing solutions for tough problems in diverse contexts to help organizations develop strategies for integrating available technologies into their service delivery.

Forsa consultants embed within organizations and communities in order to understand the your unique challenges. We’ll use field research and data analytics to gain a holistic understanding of contexts and challenges to help your organization develop bespoke solutions. This includes developing approaches to tackle old problems with new technologies, helping teams learn how to re-deploy existing resources, and assisting organizations engage with the best developers to supply the right technology for the unique circumstances.
