_We are a design, implementation, and management firm.  We work in complex environments to help governments, local and international organizations, and businesses understand the context of the problems they face.  We have years of experience using technology, data and social sciences on an international stage._

For instance, in Libya, we were brought in as consultants to design and build the worldâ€™s first SMS-based voter registration system for the Libyan Election Commission.  Over the course of the 6 month project we negotiated user experience design, led technical and political integration between different Libyan government entities, managed client requirements and software development, and analyzed user data to inform policy decisions made by the Elections Commission.

We bring this expertise to the table with our clients, working with them and their consumers to develop and deploy the most appropriate solution for the situation, utilizing a number of different tools to bring about the desired outcome.
