Incorporated provides a great typography, responsive design, author details, semantic markup and more.

You can set customize post covers, and other things directly in the post front matter:

{% highlight yaml %}
this is some test of the 'highlight yaml'
{% endhighlight %}



**Zoomable images**
<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/incorporated.jpg"></div>

**Awesome quotes**
> “Effective companies tend to communicate more, their people are curious and they have opinions”

Stay tuned for updates.
